Pod Members: **Pamela Mensah, Lauritz Patterson, and Senaf Geleta**

## Problem Statement

In fast-paced academic and professional environments, individuals often struggle to balance productivity with emotional wellness. Existing calendar tools are rigid and task-centric, failing to accommodate fluctuations in mood and energy levels, leading to burnout, procrastination, or overwhelm. Our target audience is everyone navigating modern life. From students, professionals, parents, creatives, caregivers, neurodivergent individuals, to anyone seeking a more balanced, emotionally intelligent way to plan their days.

## User Roles

1. Professional-  a user who is seeking a way to maximize their workday and 
be more productive without burning out.

2. Student - A college student juggling work and studies trying to optimize their limited time whilst managing stress and energy.

3. Everyday User- An individual who is looking to maximize and better plan out their personal time.
