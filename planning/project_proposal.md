# Project Proposal

Pod Members: **Pamela Mensah, Lauritz Patterson, Senaf Geleta**

## Problem Statement

In fast-paced academic and professional environments, individuals often struggle to balance productivity with emotional wellness. Existing calendar tools are rigid and task-centric, failing to accommodate fluctuations in mood and energy levels, leading to burnout, procrastination, or overwhelm. Our target audience is everyone navigating modern life. From students, professionals, parents, creatives, caregivers, neurodivergent individuals, to anyone seeking a more balanced, emotionally intelligent way to plan their days.

## Description

Our project is a professional, mood-aware calendar website designed to help users plan their day more effectively by aligning tasks with how they feel. The main purpose is to make scheduling both productive and emotionally supportive for everyone, regardless of lifestyle or profession. Some key features will be the main mood-aware toggleable calendar, smart suggestions that automatically suggest additions to the calendar, AI-Powered personalization, and gamified productivity. The targeted audience would be everyone, as it would be designed to assist anyone looking to better optimize their time. The website would offer a flexible and personalized planning experience. By combining AI powered insights with a clean interface, users can organize their lives in a natural and rewarding way.

## Related Work

Several apps offer pieces of what Prism provides. Google Calendar and Notion help with productivity but do not account for emotional state. Daylio and Reflectly focus on mood tracking and journaling but lack scheduling tools. Wellness apps like Headspace promote mindfulness but are not designed for planning. Prism stands out by combining emotional awareness with task management in one intuitive platform. It does not just track your mood and personality, it uses it to guide your planning, suggesting personalized activities during calendar gaps. With features like visual mood-task graphs, personalized suggestions, and gamified motivation, Prism makes planning feel flexible, supportive, and most importantly human, something other tools do not fully offer.

## Open Questions

Some questions we still have include how to accurately interpret a user’s mood. Should we rely on manual input via a survey for example or use other tools like OpenAi’s sentiment analysis but still solve the bias of AI in giving accuracy? We are also considering exactly how much to personalize task recommendations based on the survey or profile the user first makes. A key question is: are we simply filling gaps, or are we trying to help users grow, by nudging them toward healthier, more fulfilling habits based on their emotional state and personal goals? For the calendar and scheduling functionality, we need to research how to integrate tools like Google Calendar and other calendars like Outlook. From a design perspective as well, we would need to explore frameworks like Figma to ensure that our surface is the best it can possibly be. We would also need to research gamification elements and how we can use React to implement that without distracting or making gamification overwhelming for users.
