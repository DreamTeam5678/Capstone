## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 We Completed the Calendar page , adding modal mood pop up, and created a task page. 

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 Trying to figure out the logic for the Optimize button 

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 Not yet. We may have over planned and put too many task for the halfway point. I believe we might be more than halfway finished . 

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 yes , we need more support on github with branching , communication with pushing/ pulling , and best practices overall . 

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 The logic of Optimize button and certain features in the task list . We will ask mentors best course of action on how to move forward .
